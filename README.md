Firedrake-HelmholtzSolver
=========================

Overview
--------
Solvers for the Helmholtz equation arising from the pressure correction PDE in semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian time stepping. Initially this is just meant to be a sandbox for playing with different solvers (first in 2d, using a simplified model equation, using existing solvers in firedrake...) but the ultimate goal is to solver the full 3d equation with a multigrid solver.
